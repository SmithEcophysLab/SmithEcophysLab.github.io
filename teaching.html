      <p>**We are beefing up the Botany curriculum at TTU. Check this ad for a list of

      <h2>Special Topics - Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology (BIOL 4301-029/6301-029)</h2>
      <p>Students in this course learn the fundamentals of ecosystem ecology. 
      This includes interactions between biological organisms and themselves as well 
      as their environment. 
      Concepts taught include water and energy cycling as well as carbon and nutrient 
      flows in natural and managed systems. This includes aboveground and belowground 
      processes. As ecosystem ecology is the largest scale of ecology, the class also 
      cover necessary concepts of individual, population, and community ecology. 
      Spatial extent of processes covered extends to the globe. 
      Temporal extent extends to millenia. 
      The class considers applied aspects of global change and human decision making. 
      Students are evaluated on their ability to discuss and disseminate course topics.
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  The course is part of a TTU-wide Creating Livable Futures initiative. The purpose 
	  of the initiative is to create opportunities for students to hear and disseminate 
	  information related to global sustainability.

      Offered Fall of odd-numbered years.
      Information and material for the Fall 2019 course can be found on the

      <h2>Plant Physiological Ecology (BIOL 4350/6350)</h2>
      <p>This course covers the fundamentals of plant physiological processes at 
      multiple scales, from the cellular to whole-plant level. 
      The class considers physiological responses to a variety of abiotic 
      and biotic conditions across space and time, including responses to expected future global changes. 
      We examine plant strategies that influence their form, function, and distribution. 
      The course considers both natural and agricultural contexts. 
      Students tackle classical literature as well as current topics in plant physiology. 
      Classes are primarily discussion based.

      <h2>Biology of Plants (BIOL 1401)</h2>
      <p>This course, intended for students not majoring in biology, provides a broad survey of plant biology. 
      Students will be able to recognize major plant groups and their characteristics, 
      describe plant structure and its relationship to plant function, and associate the 
      survival of plants with expression of genes controlling plant function. 
      The course includes a lab section and satisfies university lab course requirements. 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Offered every Spring/Fall  and is taught by Nick in even-year semesters.

      <h2>Undergraduate Research in Plant Ecophysiology (1 credit; BIOL 4100)</h2>
      <p>As part of this research experience, undergraduates learn research techniques under 
      the supervision of Nick Smith and members of the Smith lab. 
      As a final project, students develop a proposal for a research project that will 
      (ideally) take place in a following semester.
      Projects may involve, but are not limited to, laboratory, greenhouse, field, and/or computer simulations. 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Offered every semester.

      <h2>Undergraduate Research in Plant Ecophysiology (3 credits; BIOL 4300)</h2>
      <p>As part of this research experience, undergraduates design and carry out their own 
      research project under the supervision of Nick Smith and members of the Smith lab. 
      Projects may involve, but are not limited to, laboratory, greenhouse, field, and/or computer simulations. 
      Ideally, projects will follow from a proposal developed in a previous semester.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Offered every semester. This course is ideal for students that have either taken 4100 or have extensive training in botany, ecology, computer science, and/or statistics.
