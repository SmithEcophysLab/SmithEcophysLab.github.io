      <a id="jose_urc"></a><h2>March 9, 2021: Jose presents his honors work on herbarium leaf C:N</h2>
      <br>
      
      <p>Lab undergradaute student Jose Villeda created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPK8tCn34Ho">
      YouTube presentation</a> detailing
      the results of his honors thesis work examining the drivers of leaf carbon:nitrogen
      rations (C:N) in herbarium samples from the Guadalupe Mountains National Park.
      Jose found that elevation was the strongest predictor of C:N, with trends
      following those expected from theory. Specifically, he found that increases
      in elevation increased leaf investment in N, resulting in lower measured
      C:N, regardless of plant type.
      
      <br>
      
      Bravo to Jose, for completing his first conference presentation. Also, he put it together
      despite a short timeline (3 weeks less than anticipated!). Throughout the rest of
      the semester, we hope to bolster the dataset by sampling more specimens. The data
      will be combined with other trait data on stomata, as well as DNA information.
      We hope to get out to GUMO later this year to do a resampling. Given that the original
      samples were from the 1970s, this will give us a really cool snapshot of how
      plant functional traits have changed over time at the park!
      
      <br>

      <br>
      <a href="news_2020archive.html">2020</a> was definitely an odd one.
      Despite the difficulties brought on by the pandemic, we were able to keep sciencing,
      albeit at a slightly reduced speed. Some highlights include
      <a href="news_2020archive.html#risa_defense">
      Risa successfully defending her thesis!!</a>
      <a href="publications.html">
      8 new publications</a>,
      lab group member presentations at virtual versions of ESA, Botany, Plant Biology (ASPB),
      and AGU conferences. Well done all!
      
      
      <br>
      On to 2021!
