      <a id="esa_ecr"></a><h2>April 13, 2022: The lab gets an award!</h2>
      <br>
      
      <p>Following a nomination by Lizz and Evan,
      Nick was named as an <a href="https://www.esa.org/blog/2022/04/12/ecological-society-of-america-announces-2022-fellows/">
      ESA Early Career Fellow</a>.
      
      <br><br>From ESA: "Early Career Fellows are members within eight years of completing 
      their doctoral training (or other terminal degree) who have advanced ecological 
      knowledge and applications and show promise of continuing to make outstanding 
      contributions to a wide range of fields served by ESA. They are elected for five years."
      
      <br><br>Although Nick's name is on the award, this is really a testament to all the awesome
      students, postdocs, and collaborators the lab has had throughout the years.
      The network of colleagues we have built are strong, supportive, and inclusive and we
      plan to keep it that way for years to come.

      <a id="urc2022"></a><h2>April 4, 2022: Morgan and Joseph present their research
      at the 2022 TTU Undergraduate Research Conference</h2>
      <br>
      
      <p>Morgan and Joseph each presented their undergradaute research projects
      that they started in Fall 2021 at the <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/true/urc/2022/">
      2022 TTU Undergraduate Research Conference (URC)</a>.
      
      <br><br>Morgan spent the Fall measuring litter decomposition and soil respiration
      at the Lubbock Nutrient Network site. She found that litter decomposed faster in
      their home plots than it did in different treatment plots, regardless of
      whether litter was moved from fertilized to control plots or from control to fertilized
      plots. Interestingly, however, the treatments did not impact decomposition or soil
      respiration rates. These are cool findings that deserve further investigation!
      
      <br><br>Joseph examined carbon costs of nitrogen acquisition in soybean using a factorial
      soil nitrogen by nitrogen fixing bacteria inoculation experiment. He found that inoculation
      reduced carbon costs of nitrogen acquisition in the low soil nitrogen treatments, but
      not in the high soil nitrogen treatments. This work furthers our understanding
      of how symbioses with nitrogen fixing bacteria influences plant functioning.
      Joseph won 2nd place in the Agriculture and Environment category for his poster!
      
      <br><br>This work was part of a Coure-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE),
      generously funded by an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2045968">
      NSF CAREER award</a>, the <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/true/">

      Undergraduate Experiences (TrUE)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/honors/">

      <br><br>Great job Morgan and Joseph!!

      <a id="helen_james"></a><h2>February 17, 2022: Helen's model of C4 photosynthetic acclimation
      published in JAMES!</h2>
      <br>
      
      <p>Former Masters student, Helen Scott, and Nick published a model of C4 photosynthetic acclimation
      in Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES). The paper can be found
      <a href = "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021MS002470">at this link</a>.
      The model code can be found
      <a href = "https://github.com/hgscott/C4model">at this link</a>.
      The functions are also incorporated into the model of photosynthetic acclimation that
      is maintained by the lab and can be called using a C4 option. This model code can be found
      <a href = "https://https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/optimal_vcmax_R">at this link</a>.
      
      <br><br>The paper introduces a new model of acclimation of C4 photosynthetic traits
      based on photosynthetic least cost theory. The model is based on the optimality principle
      that plants should set up their photosynthetic traits such that carbon assimilation is
      maximized at the lowest resource use. The model predicts many traits including
      the ratio of intercellular to
      atmospheric CO2 (Ï‡), the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), the maximum rate
      of PEP carboxylation (Vpmax), and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax),
      as well as gross carbon assimilation.
      
      <br><br>The model corroborates previous studies and shows that C4 photosynthesis
      is most beneficial under hot, dry, low CO2 conditions. Comparisons to remotely
      sensed C4 cover showed that C4 presence is predictable from these responses.
      The model is suitable for incorporation into land surface and Earth system models
      and folks are encouraged to contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a>
      if they would like to discuss this further.
      
      <br><br>Zinny, Jeff, and others in the lab will be following up on this work using
      a combination of modeling, field, and controlled environment experiments
      to better understand photosynthetic acclimation in a changing world.
