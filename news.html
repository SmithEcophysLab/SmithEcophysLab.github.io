      <h2><p>August 16, 2018:</h2><h3> Lizz and Nick just returned from a two-week, multi-conference journey to Minneapolis for the annual NutNet workshop and New Orleans for this year's Ecological Society of America meeting.
      <br>
      <br>
      At the NutNet workshop, we got to meet and mingle with other NutNetters.
      Our hosts, notably Elizabeth Borer, Eric Seabloom, and Ashley Asmus, emphasized productivity.
      As such, Lizz and I got to work developing a project that will examine leaf-to-whole-plant nitrogen allocation across a subset of the NutNet sites.
      We also started developing a physiology add-on experiment to examine plant carbon and water relations in response to nutrient additions across the network.

      At ESA, Lizz presented some of her postdoctoral work on leaf-to-whole-plant physiological responses to nitrogen addition.
      Nick spoke in an organized session on photosynthetic temperature acclimation about modeling acclimation from first principles.
      Please contact Nick if you'd like a copy of his presentation.

      <h2><p>July 21, 2018:</h2><h3> Nick spent the week in Indiana resampling plots at the Prairie Invasion and Climate Experiment (PRICLE).
      <br>
      <br>
      PRICLE was nitrogen addition by rainfall variability experiment that ran from 2012-2014.
      The experiment was located in a mixed-grass prairie dominated by Canada goldenrod (<i>Solidago canadensis</i>) and little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>).
      <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.12593"> The treatments acted to synergistically reduce plant species diversity and evenness by promoting the dominance of <i>S. canadensis</i>.</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      Although the experimental treatments ended after the 2014 growing season, the plots were kept in place.
      Nick resampled the plots this week to examine whether the short-term effects of the treatments persisted after the manipulations ended.
      That is, were the effects transient or did they result in a permanent change to the plant community?
      <br>
      <br>
      Stay tuned for the answer!

      <h2><p>July 11, 2018:</h2><h3> Nick, along with TTU Biology professors John Zak and Natasja Van Gestel, spent the morning at RN Hopper's farm in Petersburg, TX.
      They were there with an engaged group of <a href = "http://southcentralclimate.org/"> South Central Climate Science Center </a> interns to learn about the impact of alternate management practices on plant and soil health.
      At the farm, we discussed how "unconventional" management practices such as no-till, dryland, cover cropping, and rotation cropping can reduce costs and increase yields.
      The students, underrepresented minority undergraduates or recent graduates, came from all over the South Central United States as part of a 3-week <a href = "http://www.southcentralclimate.org/index.php/pages/news/760"> internship </a> that includes trips to Texas Tech, the University Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University, and Louisiana State University.
      As part of their stay at TTU, they will be learning everything from biology to climate modeling to climate communication to social and ethical issues surrounding climate science.

      <h2><p>July 3, 2018:</h2><h3> Check out a new paper from the lab, led by colleague Danica Lombardozzi (NCAR), entitled <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aacf68"> "Triose phosphate limitation in photosynthesis models reduces leaf photosynthesis and global terrestrial carbon storage."</a> 
      The unformatted version of the paper came out in Environmental Research Letters last week. The paper examines the sensitivity of models to TPU limitation, the understudied third limitation of photosynthesis. 
      We find that leaf photosynthesis and global terrestrial biosphere models are sensitive to how TPU limitation is parameterized. 
      For the leaf model, TPU limitation becomes more important at cold temperatures, high CO2 levels, and high light levels. 
      In a global model, the implementation of increased TPU limitation has a negative impact on simulated terrestrial carbon uptake and storage under present-day and future climates. 
      However, while we find TPU is an important process limiting photosynthesis globally, we note that it is highly understudied. 
      We need further experiments dedicated ot understanding TPU under various conditions and the acclimation of this process in particular.

      <h2><p>Apr 30, 2018:</h2><h3> Nick just had a new paper published in Ecology entitled "Drivers of leaf carbon exchange capacity across biomes at the continental scale."
      The paper examines the factors that influence photosynthetic and leaf respiratory traits across a variety of different plants and ecosystems.
      The study uses the <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.1992?campaign=wolacceptedarticle">LCE dataset</a> to drive the analyses.
      The dataset includes leaf gas exchange and trait data from 98 species spanning a 53° latitudinal gradient from Costa Rica to Alaska.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      The study finds that recent temperature and soil moisture interact to influence photosynthetic capacity.
      In dry areas, photosynthetic capacity is reduced with warming, but the downregulation trend is not apparent in wetter areas.
      This finding may reconcile meta-analytical studies that have found both a downregulation (Ali et al., 2015) and no response (e.g., Kattge and Knorr, 2007) of photosynthetic capacity to warming.
      The results also indicate that photosynthesis is more responsive to short-term (weekly) changes in temperature and soil moisture than it is to long-term climate.
      On the other hand, leaf respiratory capacity is less variable than photosynthesis and more responsive to long-term climate.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      In the Smith lab and with a global group of collaborators, we are now working on developing theoretical models to predict these responses from first principles.
      Stay tuned for more to come!

      <h2><p>Jan 17, 2018:</h2><h3> We just published <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/10/1/ply003/4812670"> an new study </a> in Annals of Botany - Plants. 
       The study comes out of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPfiKMY8Kw"> Boston Area Climate Experiment (BACE)</a>, a warming by precipitation manipulation experiment in Waltham, MA. 
       In the study, led by <a href="https://vikkirodgers.weebly.com/"> Vikki Rodgers</a>, we examined seedling trait responses (from leaf- to whole-plant scale) to the treatments and found that warming exacerbated plant sensitivity to rainfall. 
       These results are consistent with other results at BACE that suggest that warming, while beneficial under high rainfall, can induce water loss that can exacerbate the negative impacts of low rainfall on ecosystem functioning. 
       See PI Jeff Duke's <a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jsdukes/lab/publications.html"> publications </a> for more results from the BACE.</p></h3>
