      <h2><p><a id="end_spring2020">May 7, 2020</a>: Some lab accomplishments as the 2020 Spring semester comes to a close</h2>
      <h3>
      <br>
      The Spring 2020 semester was certainly a unique one! Despite a major bump in the road
      with the closing of campus and shut down of research activities due to COVID-19,
      there were still a ton of accomplishments. Some highlights:
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Risa submitted her masters thesis to her committee, which she will defend this summer.
      Risa's masters work culminated in two chapters that will comprise two manuscripts.
      In the first study, she quantifies the mechanisms underlying differences in winter and
      summer crop albedo and stomatal conductance. In the second, she used a more targeted study
      to define the drivers of winter crop albedo and latent heat flux. These novel results
      (and data!) will hopefully help define these critical processes in land surface models
      as they continue to incorporate more agricultural practices.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Evan successfully completed and presented his PhD proposal. He has outline four exciting
      projects that will constitute his thesis examining coupled aboveground-belowground
      processes and their impact on leaf-level and whole-plant processes. The proposal included
      a novel combination of theory and data (both observational and manipulative) that,
      once completed, will improve our understanding and ability to model the interactions between
      plants, microbial symbionts, and soil nutrition under global change.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Abigail finished her undergraduate research project examining forage grasses suitable for
      agricultural reclamation on saline lands. Using four species grown under different levels of
      soil salinity, she quantified salinity tolerance as well as impacts to leaf nutrition via
      leaf carbon and nitrogen measurements. She is writing up her results for publication,
      a huge accomplishment from an undergraduate project!
      
      <br>

      <h2><p><a id="biochar2020">May 7, 2020</a>: Two new biochar articles</h2>
      <h3>
      <br>
      Nick, along with colleague Jeff Licht (UMass-Boston), published two new articles
      examining the use of biochar to improve plant performance in two different contexts.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <a href = "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00031/full">
      In one article, published in Frontiers in Forests and Global Change</a>, we found
      that anthropogenic biochar had a similarly positive effect on pitch pine (<i>Pinus rigida</i>)
      performance as natural biochar in a Massachusetts forest. Fire has been suppressed for many years in these
      forests for many years and anthropogenic biochar provides an avenue for adding back in
      some of the positive soil effects of fire, without having to use controlled burns.</h3>

      In a second article, published in the Israel Journal of Ecology and Evolution</a>,
      we found that biochar improved the physiological performance
      of wild indigo (<i>Baptisia tinctoria</i>) grown on a green roof in Massachusetts.
      It is difficult to grow perennial C3 plants on green roofs due to the necessary use
      of poor, shallow soils. Our results show that anthropogenic biochar may improve soil quality
      and boost the performance of wild indigo, results that may be extended to other
      species that are hard to grow on rooftops.</h3>

      <h2><p><a id="pmodel">April 5, 2020</a>: New model publication: P-model version 1.0</h2>
      <h3>
      <br>
      Nick contributed to a recent <a href = "https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/13/1545/2020/">publication</a> 
      led by Beni Stocker (ETH Zurich) that details a new land surface modeling scheme for simulating GPP based
      on plant optimality. The model, called the P-model, simulates terrestrial GPP following
      theory developed by members of the authorship group, most notably Wang Han (Tsinghua University)
      and Colin Prentice (Imperial College London).
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      In the paper, we test the model against observational data, showing that this simple model
      can capture many observed spatial and temporal dynamics in GPP (r2 = 0.75 across 126 sites).
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The model includes tractable and testable mechanisms that we hope to improve upon
      in future modeling and experimental studies.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The model is freely available as an <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpmodel/index.html">
      R package</a> and we encourage its use by other interested research groups.</h3>

      <h2><p><a id="wang_respiration">February 29, 2020</a>: New publication on optimal respiration</h2>
      <h3>
      <br>
      Nick was part of a study led by Wang Han (Tsinghua University) on optimal leaf dark respiration that was 
      <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.14980">published
      as an Early View article in Global Change Biology this week.</a>
      The paper explores a new model that predicts leaf dark respiration from photosynthetic least cost
      optimality theory. Specifically, the paper tests the theory that much of leaf dark respiration
      is used to maintain Rubisco carboxylation. The model predicts optimal rates of carboxylation
      under varying environments, as well as the ratio of dark respiration to carboxylation
      under varying environments. From this, the temperature sensitivity, and thus optimal
      temperature acclimation of leaf dark respiration can be predicted. 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The analyses indicated that the optimal model matched the empirical data.
      This indicates that leaf respiration in predominantly driven by changes in Rubisco
      carboxylation and that this response can be predicted from an optimal photosynthesis model.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The model was developed such that it can be easily incorporated into land surface models
      as a means to improve their reliability.

      <br>
      Oklahoma University professor Heather McCarthy visited Lubbock to speak to the
      Biology department about all the cool Southern Great Plains ecophysiology
      she is doing. Heather talked to us about switchgrass drought tolerance,
      red cedar encroachment, and urban plant resilience to climate change.
      We were also able to chat with Heather about the cool research folks are doing here,
      which included a visit to the lbb.us Nutrient Network site.

      <h2><p><a id="npsot">January 18, 2020</a>: Nick gives an outreach talk to the Texas Native Plants Society</h2>
      <h3>
      <br>
      Nick visited Alpine, Texas to give a seminar on the resilience of West Texas flora
      to the Big Bend chapter of the <a href='https://npsot.org/wp/latest/'>Texas Native Plant Society</a>.
      The talk was part of a program on the potential impacts of climate change
      on the flora of the Big Bend and Trans Pecos (pronounced "paycos" as Nick was reminded!).
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The talk was attended by concerned citizens and scientists alike. Nick presented
      some reasons for optimism for the local flora (West Texas plants are tough!), but
      also some reasons for concern for the region. In short: while these plants have the physiological
      capabilities to withstand future climates, impacts at higher ecological levels could
      be detrimental. These include community- and ecosystem- level impacts. Nick's talk
      can be accessed <a href='https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/seminar/tree/master/bigbend_2020'>
