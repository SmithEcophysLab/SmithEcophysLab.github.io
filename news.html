        <strong>Nitrogen demand, availability, and acquisition strategy control plant responses to elevated CO2
        </strong></a>
        <br>
        Evan led a complex multifactor experiment showing that elevated CO2 consistently decreases
        leaf photosynthetic capacity across 18 levels of nutrient availability.
        This finding shows support for optimal photosynthetic downregulation that
        is independent of nutrient availability. This experimental work corroborates

        grassland dat (including data from the Nutrient Network data) to show that
        dominant species determine species richness, while the absolute abundance of those species

        Astrid Odé from Hugo de Boer's lab at Utrecth University led a paper in Annals of Botany
        exploring the different temporal responses of photosynthetic processes, from near

        Figure 1 from the paper illustrating depicting various symbioses with mycorrhizal fungi 
        employing distinct nutrient acquisition strategies: (a) mycorrhizal fungi 
        using a scavenging strategy include arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and 
        are estimated to receive c. 6.2% of a plant's total net primary productivity 
        (NPP) (Hawkins et al., 2023). Mycorrhizal fungi using a mining strategy include 
        (b) ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF), which are estimated to receive c. 13.1% of a 
        plant's total NPP 
        (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982223001677">Hawkins et al., 2023</a>),
        and (c) ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ErMF), 
        which are estimated to receive c. 3.5% of a plant's total NPP (Hawkins et al., 2023). 
        The extensive extraradical mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi expands the root system's 
        surface area-to-volume ratio, enhancing the fungi's capacity to scavenge soluble 
        inorganic forms of nutrients and absorb water. The tree-like arbuscular structures 
        and coils of AMF formed by intraradical hyphae within root cortical cells 
        facilitate the transfer of these resources to root cells. Several species of 
        EcMF and ErMF possess a high capacity to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes 
        that decompose soil organic material and release nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) 
        from insoluble organic complexes, granting them scavenging and mining abilities.

        <br>
        <p>
        Plants need resources like nutrients and water to grow, and they adopt different 
        strategies to acquire these resources from the soil. However, acquiring nutrients 
        comes at a cost—plants must invest carbon belowground to support root systems and 
        microbial partnerships. But how do these costs change depending on soil conditions, 
        water availability, and plant nutrient-acquisition strategies? And how are these 
        costs coupled with photosynthetic acclimation processes?
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
		In this new study, we tackled these questions using a global dataset of leaf carbon 
		isotopes, spanning a wide range of plant species and environmental conditions. 
		By applying an eco-evolutionary optimality framework
		(<a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17558">Harrison et al., 2021</a>; 
		<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-020-0655-x">Franklin et al., 2020</a>)
		that links soil resources to leaf-level photosynthetic 
		acclimation, we estimated the carbon costs of acquiring nutrients relative to 
		water and uncovered key patterns.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The findings reveal that these costs decrease as soil nitrogen availability increases 
		but increase with increasing moisture—yet this pattern depends on how plants acquire 
		nutrients (Figure 1; see below).
		Specifically, plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal 
		fungi experience lower costs when inorganic soluble nitrogen is abundant, as these 
		fungi efficiently scavenge soluble inorganic nitrogen. In contrast, plants associated 
		with ectomycorrhizal and ericoid fungi experience lower costs in nitrogen-poor soils, 
		where these fungi can break down organic matter using specialized enzymes.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		Moisture plays a different role. Our study found that the carbon costs of 
		acquiring nutrients relative to water increase with higher moisture levels, 
		but mainly for plants relying on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. This suggests 
		that for these plants, wetter conditions directly influence the cost of maintaining 
		transpiration, altering their carbon investment strategies. Finally, the modulation 
		of these costs by phosphorus availability depended on the indirect effects of 
		moisture on soil phosphorus. Interestingly, the effects vary by biome. In tropical 
		and subtropical ecosystems, both moisture and nitrogen availability shape these costs. 
		However, in temperate and boreal regions, where nitrogen is the primary limiting 
		factor for growth, only soil nitrogen availability plays a key role.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		This study highlights that plants minimize resource acquisition costs in a 
		predictable way, balancing trade-offs between water and nutrients depending 
		on their environment and strategy. These findings emphasize the need to 
		refine Earth System Models using optimality theory to better integrate how 
		plants adjust their carbon investments in response to resource availability.

        Figure 1 from the paper. This conceptual illustration depicts how climatic factors
        influence leaf nitrogen demand and responses to soil nitrogen supply. increased
        aridity reduces stomatal conductance, decreasing CO2 levels and increasing leaf
        nitrogen demand through rubisco upregulation. lower temperatures and higher incoming
        radiation further enhance leaf nitrogen demand, impacting overall plant growth and biomass.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        The paper uses leaf chemistry data
        (<a href= "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0790-1">Firn et al., 2019</a>)
        from the <a href="https://nutnet.org/">Nutrient Network</a>
        to show that sites that have the greatest leaf nitrogen response to soil nitrogen
        fertilization are those where we would expect there to be the greatest demand for photosynthetic leaf
        nitrogen.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        From theory (see review by <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.20178">Stocker et al. (2024)</a>)
        we can predict how climatic factors should drive photosynthetic leaf nitrogen demand.
        This theory predicts that leaf nitrogen demand should increase with aridity and sunlight,
        and decrease with temperature. The new paper shows that the responsiveness of leaf nitrogen
        to soil nitrogen across the network increases with these factors (see figure below).
        
        <br>
        <br>
        This study provides a novel confirmation of our theoretical understanding of plant nitrogen
        dynamics. This can serve as a baseline for developing new models
        (e.g., <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.20178">Stocker et al. (2024)</a>)
        for simulating these responses, ultimately improving simulations of terrestrial carbon-nitrogen cycle
        interactions.
