      <h2><p><a id="CTSM_tutorial">February 4, 2019</a>: Lizz and Risa learn CTSM!</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3> 
      Lizz and Risa have begun a week-long tutorial to learn how to simulate global
      terrestrial ecosystem processes using the Community Terrestrial Systems Model 
      (CTSM). The tutorial will take place at the National Center for Atmospheric 
      Research in Boulder, CO. There is an amazing list of speakers. 
      The rest of the lab is excited to hear what they learn!
      <br>
      <br>
      Lizz is hoping to use the CTSM to explore the impact of nitrogen on plant 
      physiological processes across large spatial and temporal scales.
      She plans to use her experimental work to provide model improvements.
      <br>
      <br>
      Risa is interested in simulating the impact of different cover crop species
      on biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks. She is interested in how these feedbacks
      change with species as well as moisture availability.
      <br>
      <br>
      More information on the tutorial can be found here: 
      <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/events/2019/ctsm/">
      http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/events/2019/ctsm/</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      As an aside, the Smith Lab is actively working on porting the CTSM to our 
      local HPCC, so that
      lab members and folks across the TTU campus can run global experiments. Stay tuned!

      <h3> 
      <br>
      <br>
      Nick led a study to examine the drivers of leaf-level photosynthesis,
      specifically the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation, commonly termed Vcmax.
      This rate is important for determining how much carbon plants take up via
      photosynthesis. However, Vcmax is known to be quite plastic over space and time,
      making it difficult to predict at large spatial and temporal scales.
      <br>
      <br>
      The authors further developed a theory for predicting optimal rates Vcmax,
      with optimization meaning maintenance of maximum carbon uptake at the lowest
      cost. The theory was driven by climate and light availability alone.
      <br>
      <br>
      When tested against a global observational dataset of Vcmax,
      the theory did quite well, explaining >60% of the variation in the observations.
      The results suggest that light available and biophysical constraints due to climate
      determine large scale patterns of Vcmax.
      The results also suggested that soil fertility was not a major driver of
      Vcmax at these scales, an effect that contrasts with theory implemented in
      Earth System Models (ESMs).
      <br>
      <br>
      The theory is a much simpler representation of acclimation than that
      is currently used in ESMs, thus providing a way to simplify these complex models,
      improving the reliability of their future predictions.
      <br>
      <br>
      The study was published online in
      <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13210">
