      <h2><p>Apr 30, 2018:</h2><h3> Nick just had a new paper published in Ecology entitled "Drivers of leaf carbon exchange capacity across biomes at the continental scale."
      The paper examines the factors that influence photosynthetic and leaf respiratory traits across a variety of different plants and ecosystems.
      The study uses the <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.1992?campaign=wolacceptedarticle">LCE dataset</a> to drive the analyses.
      The dataset includes leaf gas exchange and trait data from 98 species spanning a 53Â° latitudinal gradient from Costa Rica to Alaska.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      The study finds that recent temperature and soil moisture interact to influence photosynthetic capacity.
      In dry areas, photosynthetic capacity is reduced with warming, but the downregulation trend is not apparent in wetter areas.
      This finding may reconcile meta-analytical studies that have found both a downregulation (Ali et al., 2015) and no response (e.g., Kattge and Knorr, 2007) of photosynthetic capacity to warming.
      The results also indicate that photosynthesis is more responsive to short-term (weekly) changes in temperature and soil moisture than it is to long-term climate.
      On the other hand, leaf respiratory capacity is less variable than photosynthesis and more responsive to long-term climate.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      In the Smith lab and with a global group of collaborators, we are now working on developing theoretical models to predict these responses from first principles.
      Stay tuned for more to come!

      <h2><p>Jan 17, 2018:</h2><h3> We just published <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/10/1/ply003/4812670"> an new study </a> in Annals of Botany - Plants. 
       The study comes out of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPfiKMY8Kw"> Boston Area Climate Experiment (BACE)</a>, a warming by precipitation manipulation experiment in Waltham, MA. 
       In the study, led by <a href="https://vikkirodgers.weebly.com/"> Vikki Rodgers</a>, we examined seedling trait responses (from leaf- to whole-plant scale) to the treatments and found that warming exacerbated plant sensitivity to rainfall. 
       These results are consistent with other results at BACE that suggest that warming, while beneficial under high rainfall, can induce water loss that can exacerbate the negative impacts of low rainfall on ecosystem functioning. 
       See PI Jeff Duke's <a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jsdukes/lab/publications.html"> publications </a> for more results from the BACE.</p></h3>
