        <a id="smith_elm"></a><h2>Nov. 4, 2024: New paper on the impact of CO2 on ecosystem
        carbon-nitrogen cycling out in <i>Global Change Biology</i></h2>
        
        <p>
        Nick led a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.17558">
        new study published in <i>Global Change Biology</i></a> titled “Acclimation of 
        photosynthesis to CO2 increases ecosystem carbon storage due to leaf nitrogen savings."
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        The paper shows that leaf nitrogen savings due to photosynthetic acclimation to elevated
        CO2 increases ecosystem carbon uptake storage through two mechanisms: (1)
        a direct alleviation of plant nitrogen limitation through reduced leaf nitrogen 
        requirements and (2) an indirect reduction in plant nitrogen limitation through an 
        enhancement of root growth that leads to increased plant nitrogen uptake.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        The paper builds on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15212">
        previous work</a> showing that plants optimally downregulate leaf nitrogen use
        via downregulation of photosynthetic proteins under elevated CO2 to enhance
        nitrogen use efficiency. This downregulation thus frees up nitrogen for use
        elsewhere, alleviating some nitrogen limitation. The model findings suggest
        that models that do not include photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 may overestimate
        future nitrogen limitation of terrestrial ecosystems and thus underestimate
        future terrestrial carbon uptake and storage.

        Tansley Review on ecosystem C-N interactions</h2>

        Evan and Nick contributed to a <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.20178">
        new <i>New Phytologist</i> Tansley Review</a> titled “Empirical evidence and 
        theoretical understanding of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycle interactions.”
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        The paper was a collaborative effort from the <a href="https://research.reading.ac.uk/lemontree/">
        LEMONTREE</a> team and was led by Beni Stocker. The TTU work was

        <br>
        
        The paper reviews experimental and observational data to outline known and unknown
        interactions between carbon and nitrogen cycling from leaf to ecosystem scales under
        various environmental conditions, with a particular focus on soil nitrogen and atmospheric
        CO2. The paper then compares this to current theoretical understanding of these processes.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        We find that nitrogen availability has a positive influence on tissue nitrogen and
        plant growth, but does not consistently impact photosynthetic traits. 
        Soil nitrogen availability also reduces root:shoot ratios. Elevated CO2 also
        boosts productivity and photosynthesis, but reduces leaf nitrogen demand.
        However, elevated CO2 increases root allocation. All responses are consistent with theory
        and we show this using a model demonstration. Nonetheless, there is still some
        variability in experiments and observations that need further investigation.

        represents the traditional approach implemented in many DGVMs, whereby the

        Direct effects of the atmospheric environment on acclimation have implications

        <a id="evan_aobp"></a><h2>Sept. 13, 2024: Evan's new paper on the effects
        of symbiotic nitrogen fixation on carbon costs to acquire nitrogen out now
        in <i>AoB Plants</i>!</h2>
        
        <p>
        The lab had a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/16/5/plae051/7756379l">
        new paper</a> published in <i>AoB Plants</i> yesterday, titled “Symbiotic nitrogen fixation 
        reduces belowground biomass carbon costs of nitrogen acquisition under low, but not high, 
        nitrogen availability”. The paper was led by current post-doc Evan Perkowski and was adapted 
        from an undergraduate thesis conducted by Joseph Terrones. Nick and former lab undergraduate 
        Hannah German also provided significant contributions to the paper.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        The paper reports findings from a greenhouse experiment where soybean seedlings were grown 
        under full-factorial combinations of two nitrogen fertilization treatments and two inoculation 
        treatments. The experiment was designed to understand how symbiotic nitrogen fixation modifies 
        plant responses to nitrogen availability. It was also a direct follow-up to some of Evan’s 
        <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/72/15/5766/6296480"> previous work </a> suggesting that carbon costs to acquire nitrogen in plants 
        that form associations with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria are less sensitive to changes 
        in nitrogen availability than species that are not capable of forming these associations.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Overall, we found that inoculation with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria decreased soybean 
        carbon costs to acquire nitrogen, but this pattern was only observed in the low nitrogen 
        fertilization treatment where seedlings invested more strongly in nitrogen fixation pathways. 
        These patterns were entirely driven by an increase in plant nitrogen uptake and were not 
        associated with a change in belowground carbon allocation. These findings may help explain 
        the prevalence of plants that form associations with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria under 
        low soil nitrogen environments and give us insight into understanding how nitrogen acquisition 
        strategy may mediate the effect of nitrogen availability on plant nutrient acquisition and 
        allocation.

      <a id="risa_ecopshere"></a><h2>February 23, 2024: Risa's new paper on biophysical 
      feedbacks from cover cropping out in <i>Ecosphere</i>!</h2>
      
      <p>
      Former lab Masters student, Risa McNellis, <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.4753">
      published her thesis work today</a> in <i>Ecopshere</i>!
      The paper uses a combination of observational data, field manipulation data, and modeling
      to examine the impact of winter cover cropping on biophysical feedbacks to climate.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      We find that winter cover cropping increases both albedo and latent heat fluxes in
      Texas High Plains agro-ecosystems. This indicates that winter cover cropping provides multiple
      direct cooling feedbacks to climate in this region. This indicates an added climate benefit of
      cover cropping on top of previous findings of increased carbon sequestration. Thus, cover
      cropping is a management practice that can increase the sustainability of agro-ecosystems
      in multiple ways.

      <a id="remi_c4"></a><h2>February 14, 2024: New paper mapping C4 vegetation</h2>
      
      <p>
      We had new paper published in <i>Nature Communications</i> entitled
      <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45606-3">
      "Mapping the global distribution of C4 vegetation using observations and optimality theory"</a>.
      The paper was led by Remi Luo (Singapore National University).
      In the paper, we show that C4 vegetation covers ~17% of the land surface, with
      values decreasing slightly over time due to a decrease in natural C4 vegetation
      that is buoyed by an increase in agricultural C4 plants. We also find that C4 plants
      constitute ~20% of global primary production.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The paper shines a light on the breadth and importance of C4 vegetation, which is still
      understudied. Future research should focus on better understanding and predicting
      the response of C4 vegetation to improve present-day and future estimates of global
      carbon cycling. Eco-evolutionary optimality approaches such as the one used in the paper,
      as well as others (e.g., <a href = "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002470">
      Scott and Smith, 2022</a>) could help with this.
