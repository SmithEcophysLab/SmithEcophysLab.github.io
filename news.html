      <a id="helen_james"></a><h2>February 17, 2022: Helen's model of C4 photosynthetic acclimation
      published in JAMES!</h2>
      <br>
      
      <p>Former Masters student, Helen Scott, and Nick published a model of C4 photosynthetic acclimation
      in Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES). The paper can be found
      <a href = "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021MS002470">at this link</a>.
      The model code can be found
      <a href = "https://github.com/hgscott/C4model">at this link</a>.
      The functions are also incorporated into the model of photosynthetic acclimation that
      is maintained by the lab and can be called using a C4 option. This model code can be found
      <a href = "https://https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/optimal_vcmax_R">at this link</a>.
      
      <br><br>The paper introduces a new model of acclimation of C4 photosynthetic traits
      based on photosynthetic least cost theory. The model is based on the optimality principle
      that plants should set up their photosynthetic traits such that carbon assimilation is
      maximized at the lowest resource use. The model predicts many traits including
      the ratio of intercellular to
      atmospheric CO2 (Ï‡), the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), the maximum rate
      of PEP carboxylation (Vpmax), and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax),
      as well as gross carbon assimilation.
      
      <br><br>The model corroborates previous studies and shows that C4 photosynthesis
      is most beneficial under hot, dry, low CO2 conditions. Comparisons to remotely
      sensed C4 cover showed that C4 presence is predictable from these responses.
      The model is suitable for incorporation into land surface and Earth system models
      and folks are encouraged to contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a>
      if they would like to discuss this further.
      
      <br><br>Zinny, Jeff, and others in the lab will be following up on this work using
      a combination of modeling, field, and controlled environment experiments
      to better understand photosynthetic acclimation in a changing world.
