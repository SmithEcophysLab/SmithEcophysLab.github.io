      Society of America meeting in Louisville, KY. While Leah couldn't attend, her
      work on mesquite was also on display (with Nick filling in). There was a great turnout for
      each talk and the ideas presented seemed to stimulate a lot of discussion amongst the
      meeting participants. As usual, ESA allowed for plenty of fun time as well,
      with old colleagues and new, including a giant troll!
      Stay tuned for publications of these works that will be coming out soon!

      in beautiful Gothic, Colorado. The purpose of the visit was to check out the site
      and facilities and set up collaborations with RMBL and the RMBL scientists
      examining climate change at high elevations and along elevational  gradients.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      While there, Nick was able to check out the famous Harte warming experiment as well
      as Aimee Classen's WaRM plots. He even got to help with some NEE measurements!
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Additional perks included some great wildlife spotting (e.g., moose, foxes, coyotes, marmots),
      a mountain marathon (well 1/3 of one!), and a 4th of July parade in homemade botanical
      outfits!

      Tyler is performing the study as part of a month-long intensive summer undergraduate

      will be writing it up in a publication-style article. This has included
      learning many new pieces of equipment and techniques (along with help
      from other lab personnel, namely Ricky Kong). I'm really proud of what Tyler has

      <h2><p><a id="CTSM_tutorial">February 4, 2019</a>: Lizz and Risa learn CTSM!</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3> 
      Lizz and Risa have begun a week-long tutorial to learn how to simulate global
      terrestrial ecosystem processes using the Community Terrestrial Systems Model 
      (CTSM). The tutorial will take place at the National Center for Atmospheric 
      Research in Boulder, CO. There is an amazing list of speakers. 
      The rest of the lab is excited to hear what they learn!
      <br>
      <br>
      Lizz is hoping to use the CTSM to explore the impact of nitrogen on plant 
      physiological processes across large spatial and temporal scales.
      She plans to use her experimental work to provide model improvements.
      <br>
      <br>
      Risa is interested in simulating the impact of different cover crop species
      on biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks. She is interested in how these feedbacks
      change with species as well as moisture availability.
      <br>
      <br>
      More information on the tutorial can be found here:

      <br>
      <br>
      As an aside, the Smith Lab is actively working on porting the CTSM to our 
      local HPCC, so that
      lab members and folks across the TTU campus can run global experiments. Stay tuned!

      <h3> 
      <br>
      <br>
      Nick led a study to examine the drivers of leaf-level photosynthesis,
      specifically the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation, commonly termed Vcmax.
      This rate is important for determining how much carbon plants take up via
      photosynthesis. However, Vcmax is known to be quite plastic over space and time,
      making it difficult to predict at large spatial and temporal scales.
      <br>
      <br>
      The authors further developed a theory for predicting optimal rates Vcmax,
      with optimization meaning maintenance of maximum carbon uptake at the lowest
      cost. The theory was driven by climate and light availability alone.
      <br>
      <br>
      When tested against a global observational dataset of Vcmax,
      the theory did quite well, explaining >60% of the variation in the observations.
      The results suggest that light available and biophysical constraints due to climate
      determine large scale patterns of Vcmax.
      The results also suggested that soil fertility was not a major driver of
      Vcmax at these scales, an effect that contrasts with theory implemented in
      Earth System Models (ESMs).
      <br>
      <br>
      The theory is a much simpler representation of acclimation than that
      is currently used in ESMs, thus providing a way to simplify these complex models,
      improving the reliability of their future predictions.
      <br>
      <br>
      The study was published online in
