      <a id="risa_ecopshere"></a><h2>February 23, 2024: Risa's new paper on biophysical 
      feedbacks from cover cropping out in <i>Ecosphere</i>!</h2>
      
      <p>
      Former lab Masters student, Risa McNellis, <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.4753">
      published her thesis work today</a> in <i>Ecopshere</i>!
      The paper uses a combination of observational data, field manipulation data, and modeling
      to examine the impact of winter cover cropping on biophysical feedbacks to climate.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      We find that winter cover cropping increases both albedo and latent heat fluxes in
      Texas High Plains agro-ecosystems. This indicates that winter cover cropping provides multiple
      direct cooling feedbacks to climate in this region. This indicates an added climate benefit of
      cover cropping on top of previous findings of increased carbon sequestration. Thus, cover
      cropping is a management practice that can increase the sustainability of agro-ecosystems
      in multiple ways.

      increases albedo and latent heat flux in a Texas High Plains agroecosystem.

      <a id="remi_c4"></a><h2>February 14, 2024: New paper mapping C4 vegetation</h2>
      
      <p>
      We had new paper published in <i>Nature Communications</i> entitled
      <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45606-3">
      "Mapping the global distribution of C4 vegetation using observations and optimality theory"</a>.
      The paper was led by Remi Luo (Singapore National University).
      In the paper, we show that C4 vegetation covers ~17% of the land surface, with
      values decreasing slightly over time due to a decrease in natural C4 vegetation
      that is buoyed by an increase in agricultural C4 plants. We also find that C4 plants
      constitute ~20% of global primary production.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The paper shines a light on the breadth and importance of C4 vegetation, which is still
      understudied. Future research should focus on better understanding and predicting
      the response of C4 vegetation to improve present-day and future estimates of global
      carbon cycling. Eco-evolutionary optimality approaches such as the one used in the paper,
      as well as others (e.g., <a href = "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002470">
      Scott and Smith, 2022</a>) could help with this.

      <p>
      After months of discussion and debate, the lab has settled on a rebranding.
      We are now the <i><u>Ph</u>ysiology for <u>Un</u>derstanding the <u>F</u>unctioning
      of <u>E</u>cosystems at <u>T</u>exas <u>T</u>ech Universit<u>y</u></i> Lab!
      The focus of the lab remains unchanged, but the name and logo (see below) are now
      way more fun! We can't wait to continue integrating plant physiology, ecosystem ecology,
      and fancy cakes!
