      <a href = "https://research.reading.ac.uk/lemontree/">LEMONTREE</a>
      for their first in-person meeting of the project in Reading, UK.
      The project meeting brought together individuals from the various groups
      working on the project. We hashed out ideas and plans for the second year of the 5-year project.

      at the 2022 Mathematical Models in Ecology and Evolution (MMEE) meeting in

      <br>
      
      <p>Brad, Zinny, and Nick deployed to the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) for
      10 days of intense plant physiology sampling. The crew, in conjunction with folks from
      U. Arizona, Oklahoma U., and U. Michigan recorded CO2 responses curves of photosynthesis
      at 8 sites along an elevational gradient. Brad will be leading an analysis of the data
      to examine how plants adjust to the changes along the gradient within and across species.
      <br>
      
      <br>In addition, we are collaborating with Rose Brinkhoff (postdoc at U. Michigan),
      who is examining similar responses along the gradient and within open-top warming chambers
      at high and low elevations.
      <br>
      
      <br>This work is being done in support of (and with support from) the
      <a href = "https://research.reading.ac.uk/lemontree/">LEMONTREE</a> project.

      <p>Ricky Kong, a former research exchange student in the lab from the University of
      Western Ontario published his findings on low temperature acclimation in <i>Plant Biology</i>.
      Using growth chambers, we acclimated <i>Populus balsamifera</i> seedlings to
      6 °C and 10 °C. The temperature treatments were crossed with two levels of nitrogen
      fertilization.
      
      <br><br>Interestingly, the instantaneous temperature responses of photosynthetic
      and respiratory biochemistry were similar for all treatments, suggesting little
      acclimation of biochemical properties. However, stomatal conductance
      rates led to increases in photosynthesis at high temperature in the 10 °C grown
      regardless of nitrogen fertilization level.

      <br><br>Morgan spent the Fall measuring litter decomposition and soil respiration
      at the Lubbock Nutrient Network site. She found that litter decomposed faster in
      their home plots than it did in different treatment plots, regardless of
      whether litter was moved from fertilized to control plots or from control to fertilized
      plots. Interestingly, however, the treatments did not impact decomposition or soil
      respiration rates. These are cool findings that deserve further investigation!
      
      <br><br>Joseph examined carbon costs of nitrogen acquisition in soybean using a factorial
      soil nitrogen by nitrogen fixing bacteria inoculation experiment. He found that inoculation
      reduced carbon costs of nitrogen acquisition in the low soil nitrogen treatments, but
      not in the high soil nitrogen treatments. This work furthers our understanding
      of how symbioses with nitrogen fixing bacteria influences plant functioning.

      published in JAMES!</h2>
      <br>
      
      <p>Former Masters student, Helen Scott, and Nick published a model of C4 photosynthetic acclimation
      in Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES). The paper can be found
      <a href = "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021MS002470">at this link</a>.
      The model code can be found
      <a href = "https://github.com/hgscott/C4model">at this link</a>.
      The functions are also incorporated into the model of photosynthetic acclimation that
      is maintained by the lab and can be called using a C4 option. This model code can be found
      <a href = "https://https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/optimal_vcmax_R">at this link</a>.
      
      <br><br>The paper introduces a new model of acclimation of C4 photosynthetic traits
      based on photosynthetic least cost theory. The model is based on the optimality principle
      that plants should set up their photosynthetic traits such that carbon assimilation is
      maximized at the lowest resource use. The model predicts many traits including
      the ratio of intercellular to
      atmospheric CO2 (χ), the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), the maximum rate
      of PEP carboxylation (Vpmax), and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax),
      as well as gross carbon assimilation.
      
      <br><br>The model corroborates previous studies and shows that C4 photosynthesis
      is most beneficial under hot, dry, low CO2 conditions. Comparisons to remotely
      sensed C4 cover showed that C4 presence is predictable from these responses.
      The model is suitable for incorporation into land surface and Earth system models
      and folks are encouraged to contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a>
      if they would like to discuss this further.
      
      <br><br>Zinny, Jeff, and others in the lab will be following up on this work using
      a combination of modeling, field, and controlled environment experiments
      to better understand photosynthetic acclimation in a changing world.
