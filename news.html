      <h2><p><a id="2020_acclimation_papers">June 23, 2020</a>: Two new lab papers on photosynthetic acclimation to global change</h2>
      <h3>
      <br>
	  
	  Nick recently authored two new papers on photosynthetic acclimation to global change. 
	  It is important to predict these responses given that photosynthesis by land plants
	  is the largest flux of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere at the Earth's surface.
	  As such, the degree to which photosynthesis acclimates to future climate conditions
	  will dictate the rate and magnitude of future climate change.
	  These goal of these studies was to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying acclimation
	  responses to help inform model formulations.
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  The first paper, <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15212">
	  published in <i>Global Change Biology</i></a>, compares observed photosynthetic acclimation
	  to temperature and carbon dioxide from experiments to those predicted from least-cost
	  theory. Least-cost theory relies on the idea that plants will acclimate their photosynthetic
	  processes such that they achieve the fastest rate of photosynthesis at the least cost,
	  primarily water and nitrogen use. The theory is simple and based on known biological
	  mechanisms and thus, by comparing the theory to data, can help to elucidate mechanisms
	  underlying acclimation responses in ways that are not possible with traditional statistical
	  techniques.
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  The result of the data-theory comparison indicated three important tenets of photosynthetic
	  acclimation in C3 plants:
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  1. <strong>Warming increases Rubisco carboxylation to a greater degree than
	  electron transport</strong>. This response has been observed in a number of studies and
	  is the result of an investment shift to Rubisco relative to electron transport proteins 
	  as temperatures warm. This is likely due to the fact that Rubisco oxygenation increases
	  to a greater rate than carboxylation with temperature. As such, a greater amount of Rubisco
	  is needed to maximize the light available for photosynthesis.
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  2. <strong>Plants decrease leaf nutrient requirements with warming and elevated CO2</strong>.
	  With warming, less enzymes are needed to maximize the light available for photosynthesis,
	  because enzymatic rates increase with temperature. Under elevated CO2, less Rubisco is needed
	  to take advantage of the light available, so plants down-regulate Rubisco as a result.
	  Both of these reduce leaf nitrogen, suggesting that leaf nitrogen demand may decrease
	  under future climate conditions.
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  3. <strong>Photosynthesis is restricted by electron transport under elevated CO2</strong>.
	  The theory-data comparison indicated that photosynthesis at high CO2 was limited by
	  electron transport, not by carboxylation, as has been previously postulated.
	  However, it was still unclear why this was the case. In fact, plants tended to decrease
	  their maximum rates of electron tranport under elevated CO2, but this was indicated as a
	  sub-optimal response. This understudied area of investigation needs further research.

	  published in <i>Annals of Botany-Plants</i></a>, details the result of a field study at the
	  <a href = "https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jsdukes/bace.html">Boston Area Climate Experiment (BACE)</a>
	  that examined temperature acclimation of photosynthesis under multiple rainfall conditions.
	  Interestingly, both the warming and rainfall treatments had little impact on
	  net photosynthesis, but the results indicated some new insights into the context-specificity
	  of photosynthetic acclimation.
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  Interestingly, the lack of a temperature acclimation response likely resulted in
	  little impact to the carbon assimilation of leaves. While stomatal conductance
	  decreased with leaf temperature, the concurrent increase in biochemical processes
	  resulted in little change to net photosynthetic rates. Leaves showed a clear
	  decrease in assimilation at leaf temperatures >30°C, but temperatures rarely
	  reached that level, even in the high warming treatments.
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  As such, these results indicate that the plants at BACE possessed the physiological
	  flexibility to maintain homeostatic rates of photosynthesis under warming (+3°C) without
	  acclimation. Because acclimation likely comes at some cost to the plant, these
	  results suggest that acclimation may not occur under all conditions, particularly if
	  photosynthesis is likely to be little impacted without acclimation.

      <h3>
      <br>
      
      Nick was involved with a new publication in <i>New Phytologist</i> led by Jennifer
      Paillassa (University of Quebec) entitled: "When and where soil is important to modify the carbon and water economy of leaves."
      The paper uses theory and data to show how soils influence leaf traits, stomatal conductance
      and photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax) in particular. The paper indicates that high soil
      nutrient availability relative to water availability leads to increased Vcmax per stomatal conductance.
      The response is reversed in relatively high water availability soils.
      These are results expected from
      the least-cost theory of photosynthesis (Wright et al., 2003).
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      This analysis increases our understanding of how soil modify leaf traits and, because of its
      link to theory, it enhances our ability to reliably model these responses.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      In his PhD work, Evan will be using experiments to follow up some of these results.

      <h2><p><a id="risa_defense">May 28, 2020</a>: Risa successfully defends her thesis on biophysical feedbacks from cover cropping</h2>
      <h3>
      <br>
      Risa successfully defended her Masters thesis entitled <i>Leaf traits drive increases in albedo and latent heat flux of winter cover crops</i>.
      Risa's thesis looked at the mechanisms underlying the biophysical impacts of winter cover cropping.
      She found that changes in leaf and whole-plant traits drive differences in albedo and latent heat flux
      between winter and summer crops. She also found that winter cover cropping can increase both
      albedo and latent heat flux as compared to land that is left fallow over the summer.
            
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Together, these two chapters indicate that <strong>winter cover cropping will have a cooling
      effects on the land surface</strong>, at least in West Texas.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Risa's novel suite of measurements have now improved our understanding of these processes
      as well as our ability to model them.

      <h3>
      <br>
      The Spring 2020 semester was certainly a unique one! Despite a major bump in the road
      with the closing of campus and shut down of research activities due to COVID-19,
      there were still a ton of accomplishments. Some highlights:
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Risa submitted her masters thesis to her committee, which she will defend this summer.
      Risa's masters work culminated in two chapters that will comprise two manuscripts.
      In the first study, she quantifies the mechanisms underlying differences in winter and
      summer crop albedo and stomatal conductance. In the second, she used a more targeted study
      to define the drivers of winter crop albedo and latent heat flux. These novel results
      (and data!) will hopefully help define these critical processes in land surface models
      as they continue to incorporate more agricultural practices.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Evan successfully completed and presented his PhD proposal. He has outline four exciting
      projects that will constitute his thesis examining coupled aboveground-belowground
      processes and their impact on leaf-level and whole-plant processes. The proposal included
      a novel combination of theory and data (both observational and manipulative) that,
      once completed, will improve our understanding and ability to model the interactions between
      plants, microbial symbionts, and soil nutrition under global change.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Abigail finished her undergraduate research project examining forage grasses suitable for
      agricultural reclamation on saline lands. Using four species grown under different levels of
      soil salinity, she quantified salinity tolerance as well as impacts to leaf nutrition via
      leaf carbon and nitrogen measurements. She is writing up her results for publication,
      a huge accomplishment from an undergraduate project!

      <h3>
      <br>
      Nick was part of a study led by Wang Han (Tsinghua University) on optimal leaf dark respiration that was 
      <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.14980">published
      as an Early View article in Global Change Biology this week.</a>
      The paper explores a new model that predicts leaf dark respiration from photosynthetic least cost
      optimality theory. Specifically, the paper tests the theory that much of leaf dark respiration
      is used to maintain Rubisco carboxylation. The model predicts optimal rates of carboxylation
      under varying environments, as well as the ratio of dark respiration to carboxylation
      under varying environments. From this, the temperature sensitivity, and thus optimal
      temperature acclimation of leaf dark respiration can be predicted. 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The analyses indicated that the optimal model matched the empirical data.
      This indicates that leaf respiration in predominantly driven by changes in Rubisco
      carboxylation and that this response can be predicted from an optimal photosynthesis model.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The model was developed such that it can be easily incorporated into land surface models

      to the Big Bend chapter of the <a href='https://npsot.org/wp/latest/'>Texas Native Plant Society</a>.
      The talk was part of a program on the potential impacts of climate change
      on the flora of the Big Bend and Trans Pecos (pronounced "paycos" as Nick was reminded!).
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The talk was attended by concerned citizens and scientists alike. Nick presented
      some reasons for optimism for the local flora (West Texas plants are tough!), but
      also some reasons for concern for the region. In short: while these plants have the physiological
      capabilities to withstand future climates, impacts at higher ecological levels could
      be detrimental. These include community- and ecosystem- level impacts. Nick's talk
      can be accessed <a href='https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/seminar/tree/master/bigbend_2020'>
