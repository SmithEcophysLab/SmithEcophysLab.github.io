      <br>
      
      <p>The Smith Ecophysiology Lab at Texas Tech University is looking for new 
      Masters and PhD students to join our group in Fall 2022. We are looking for 
      students interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying plant physiological 
      acclimation to global change and the resulting impacts these processes have on 
      future Earth system dynamics. Prospective students should have a background in plant 
      physiology, plant ecology, Earth system science, or similar field. More information 
      on the lab can be found at smithecophyslab.com. Students are encouraged to have a 
      look at recent <a href="publications.html">publications</a> from the lab prior to applying.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      Further informatioin about the positions and how to apply can be found on the
      <a href="opportunities.html#grad_2022">opportunities page</a> and in the ad below.

      <br>
      
      <p>Former lab undergraduate research student, Abigail Bell, had her first authored
      paper from her time in the lab published in 
      <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550742421000348"><i>Rangeland Ecology and Management</i></a>.
      The paper examines changes in growth and nutrient status of four forage grasses to
      a soil salinity gradient. Abigail found that the responses were highly species specific.
      By outlining these responses, the paper provides recommendations for species selection
      by land owners looking to restore saline lands.

      fertilize our Nutrient Network sites. It was a beautiful day and we had lots of
      fun trampling through the spring prairie.

      on the impact of an allelopathic invaded on plant economic traits</h2>
      <br>
      
      <p>Nick collaborated with a group of researchers from the University of Tennessee,
      led by Lalasia Bialic-Murphy, to examine the impact of an allelopathic invader
      on plant economic traits. The invader, garlic mustard (<i>Alliaria petiolata</i>).
      The allelochemicals produced by garlic mustard disrupt the native plant-fungal symbioses.
      This disruption caused shifts in the plant economic traits suggesting that invasion
      was increasing the cost of nutrient uptake by the native plants. In response, the plants
      shifted to a greater water use to maintain carbon assimilation at a lower nutrient use.
      These shifts are predicted by least cost theory. The study is one of the first to
      show these dynamics playing out in an invasion context.
      
      <br>

      <a id="jose_urc"></a><h2>March 9, 2021: Jose presents his honors work on herbarium leaf C:N</h2>
      <br>
      
      <p>Lab undergradaute student Jose Villeda created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPK8tCn34Ho">
      YouTube presentation</a> detailing
      the results of his honors thesis work examining the drivers of leaf carbon:nitrogen
      rations (C:N) in herbarium samples from the Guadalupe Mountains National Park.
      Jose found that elevation was the strongest predictor of C:N, with trends
      following those expected from theory. Specifically, he found that increases
      in elevation increased leaf investment in N, resulting in lower measured
      C:N, regardless of plant type.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Bravo to Jose, for completing his first conference presentation. Also, he put it together
      despite a short timeline (3 weeks less than anticipated!). Throughout the rest of
      the semester, we hope to bolster the dataset by sampling more specimens. The data
      will be combined with other trait data on stomata, as well as DNA information.
      We hope to get out to GUMO later this year to do a resampling. Given that the original
      samples were from the 1970s, this will give us a really cool snapshot of how
      plant functional traits have changed over time at the park!

      Despite the difficulties brought on by the pandemic, we were able to keep sciencing,
