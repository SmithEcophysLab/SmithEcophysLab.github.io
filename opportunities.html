      <a id="postdocs"></a><h2>Postdocs</h2>
      <p>The lab is currently looking for a new postdoc in plant ecophysiology to start
      as early as January 1, 2023. Full information about the position can be found
      in the advertisement <a href = "ads/postdoc_ad_sep2022.pdf">HERE</a>. This is also
      summarized below:
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      A postdoctoral position examining plant physiological responses to environmental 
      variability is available in the lab of Dr. Nick Smith in the Department of 
      Biological Sciences at Texas Tech University. The Smith Ecophysiology Lab 
      examines the responses of plants and ecosystems to change in abiotic conditions 
      and the resulting feedbacks from these responses to global change. The successful 
      applicant will join a vibrant group of researchers in the Lab, which is housed 
      within the new EcoHealth Lab facility. The postdoc will work closely with an 
      international group of collaborators focused on improving understanding and 
      predictability of plant physiological processes and their feedbacks to ecosystem 
      processes under global change.
      
      <br>
      The postdoc will be given freedom to explore questions and develop projects 
      pertinent to their interests and experiences. These should be overlap with 
      one or more of the following ongoing themes in the lab:
      <ul>
      <li>Plant physiological acclimation to global change</li>
      <li>Development of quantitative plant ecophysiological theory</li>
      <li>The impact of belowground resource availability on plant physiological processes</li>
      <li>Scaling from leaves to the globe</li>
      <li>Interactions between plants and microbial symbionts and the impact on physiology</li>
      <li>Species and functional type specific responses to global change</li>
      <li>Land surface and Earth system modeling</li>
      <li>Plant resource uptake and use optimization</li>
      </ul>
      
      Within the EcoHealth Lab, the postdoc will have access to state-of-the-art 
      ecophysiological equipment, growth chamber and greenhouse facilities, as well as 
      computational facilities both within the lab and through the University’s High 
      Performance Computing Center. The Smith Ecophysiology Lab is also part of the 
      Nutrient Network and maintains an active site locally (lubb.us).
      
      <br>
       <br>
      <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
      The successful candidate will carry out empirical and modeling research examining 
      plant physiological responses and feedbacks to environmental variability. 
      The specific projects will be tailored to the individual’s interests and expertise. 
      The position will also involve mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students 
      in the lab.
      
      <br>
       <br>
      <h3>Required Qualifications</h3>
      The applicant must have a Ph.D. by the start date with expertise in plant 
      physiology, physiological ecology, global change biology, ecological modeling, 
      or related field.
      
      <br>
       <br>
      <h3>Desired Qualifications</h3>
      Experience carrying out manipulation experiments examining plant physiological 
      responses is highly desirable. Strong quantitative skills are also highly desired.
      
      <br>
       <br>
      <h3>Start Date</h3>
      Preference will be given to applicants that can start by or before January 1, 2023. 
      However, later start dates may be possible.
      
      <br>
       <br>
      <h3>Salary</h3>
      Salary is expected to be $60,000 per year plus benefits. Funding is available for
       multiple years, but is contingent on satisfactory progress, which will be 
       evaluated at the end of each year.
       
       <br>
       <br>
       <h3>How to Apply</h3>
       To apply, please submit a CV, a 1-2 page description of your research 
       accomplishments and future goals, and the names and contact information of 
       3 referees to the Texas Tech Brass Ring portal (job number: 30497BR).
