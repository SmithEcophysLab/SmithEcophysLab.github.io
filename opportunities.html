      <a id="open"></a><h2>NEW POSTDOC OPPORTUNITY</h2>
      <p>The Smith lab is currently looking for a postdoc in plant ecophysiology.
      <br>
      <p>The full job ad and how to apply can be found <a href="ads/postdoc_ad_feb2021.pdf">here</a></p>
      <br>
      <p>The postdoctoral research assistant will be given freedom to explore questions 
      and develop projects pertinent to their interests and experiences. 
      These should be overlap with one or more of the following ongoing themes in the lab:
      <ul>
      	<li>Plant physiological acclimation to global change</li>
      	<li>Development of quantitative plant ecophysiological theory</li>
      	<li>The impact of belowground resource availability on plant physiological processes</li>
      	<li>Scaling from leaves to the globe</li>
      	<li>Interactions between plants and microbial symbionts and the impact on physiology</li>
      	<li>Species and functional type specific responses to global change</li>
      	<li>Land surface and Earth system modeling</li>
      	<li>Plant resource uptake and use optimization</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Within the EcoHealth Lab, the postdoc will have access to state-of-the-art 
      ecophysiological equipment, growth chamber and greenhouse facilities, as well as 
      computational facilities both within the lab and through the University’s High 
      Performance Computing Center. The Smith Lab is also part of the Nutrient Network 
      and maintains an active site locally (lubb.us).</p>
      <br>
      <p>The successful candidate will carry out empirical and modeling research 
      examining plant physiological responses and feedbacks to environmental variability. 
      The specific projects will be tailored to the individual’s interests and expertise. 
      The position will also involve mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in the lab.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Interested parties are encouraged to contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a> 
      prior to applying.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Again, the full job ad and how to apply can be found <a href="ads/postdoc_ad_feb2021.pdf">here</a></p>
      <br>
      
      <a id="grad"></a><h2>Graduate Students</h2>
      <p>The Smith lab is always looking for highly motivated Masters and Ph.D. students.
      <br>
      <p>The lab is fully equipped to explore the response and feedback of plants to environmental change. 
      I am interested in students with diverse backgrounds in any one or combination of 
      plant physiology, ecology, mathematics, statistics, or modeling. 
      Though, a desire to broaden your skills is strongly preferred!</p>
      <br>
      <p>As a graduate student in my lab, you will be given the freedom to explore topics 
      and develop projects that you are passionate about. 
      To encourage the development of new skills, I may ask you to step outside your comfort zone. 
      I encourage collaboration among lab members as well as with other researchers at 
      Texas Tech and institutions with which we collaborate, including universities and national laboratories.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There is competitive funding to support students through a combination of 
      Research and Teaching Assistantships and internal fellowships. 
      Additionally, we have funds for multi-scale field, lab, and computational experiments 
      as well as dissemination of research at local, national, and international meetings.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Interested students can apply through the 
      <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/">Biology Department at Texas Tech</a>. 
      Further information, including application instructions and degree requirements can 
      be found <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/academics/graduate/">here</a>.
       Interested students are encouraged to contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a> 
       prior to applying.</p>
      <br>
      
      <a id="postdocs"></a><h2>Postdocs</h2>
      <p>The lab currently has funds to support postdocs on various projects
      examining physiological acclimation to global change.
      While funding is tied to specific projects, there will be opportunities for
      the postdocs to expand the research scope to fit their interests and expertise.
      Postdocs will also be given career development opportunities including
      presentation of research at international conferences as well as teaching and
      mentoring experiences as appropriate/desired.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We are still tidying up some legalize necessary for making a formal announcement
      of the positions. However, if you are interested you are encouraged to
      contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a>.</p>
      <br>
