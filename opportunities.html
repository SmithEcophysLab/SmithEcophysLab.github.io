      <a id="grad"></a><h2>Graduate Students</h2>
      <p>The Smith lab is always looking for highly motivated Masters and Ph.D. students.
      <br>
      <p>The lab is fully equipped to explore the response and feedback of plants to environmental change. 
      I am interested in students with diverse backgrounds in any one or combination of 
      plant physiology, ecology, mathematics, statistics, or modeling. 
      Though, a desire to broaden your skills is strongly preferred!</p>
      <br>
      <p>As a graduate student in my lab, you will be given the freedom to explore topics 
      and develop projects that you are passionate about. 
      To encourage the development of new skills, I may ask you to step outside your comfort zone. 
      I encourage collaboration among lab members as well as with other researchers at 
      Texas Tech and institutions with which we collaborate, including universities and national laboratories.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There is competitive funding to support students through a combination of 
      Research and Teaching Assistantships and internal fellowships. 
      Additionally, we have funds for multi-scale field, lab, and computational experiments 
      as well as dissemination of research at local, national, and international meetings.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Interested students can apply through the 
      <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/">Biology Department at Texas Tech</a>. 
      Further information, including application instructions and degree requirements can 
      be found <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/academics/graduate/">here</a>.
       Interested students are encouraged to contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a> 
       prior to applying.</p>
      <br>
      
      <a id="postdocs"></a><h2>Postdocs</h2>
      <p>The lab currently has funds to support 1-2 postdocs on various projects
      examining physiological acclimation to global change.
      While funding is tied to specific projects, there will be opportunities for
      the postdocs to expand the research scope to fit their interests and expertise.
      Postdocs will also be given career development opportunities including
      presentation of research at international conferences as well as teaching and
      mentoring experiences as appropriate/desired.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We are still tidying up some legalize necessary for making a formal announcement
      of the positions. However, if you are interested you are encouraged to
      contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a>.</p>
