      <h2><p>Graduate Students</p></h2>
      <br>
      <h3><p>The Smith lab is looking for highly motivated Masters and Ph.D. students to start in the Fall of 2018.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The lab is fully equipped to explore the response and feedback of plants to environmental change. I am interested in students with diverse backgrounds in any one or combination of plant physiology, ecology, mathematics, statistics, or modeling. Though, a desire to broaden your skills is strongly preferred!</p>
      <br>
      <p>As a graduate student in my lab, you will be given the freedom to explore topics and develop projects that you are passionate about. To encourage the development of new skills, I may ask you to step outside your comfort zone. I encourage collaboration among lab members as well as with other researchers at Texas Tech and institutions with which we collaborate, including universities and national laboratories.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I have funding to support students year round through a combination of Research and Teaching Assistantships. Additionally, we have funds for multi-scale field, lab, and computational experiments as well as dissemination of research at local, national, and international meetings.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Interested students can apply through the <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/">Biology Department at Texas Tech</a>. Further information, including application instructions and degree requirements can be found <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/graduate/graduatestudies.php">here</a>. Interested students are encouraged to contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a> prior to applying.</p></h3>
      <br>
      <h2><p>Postdocs</p></h2>
      <br>
      <h3><p>At the moment, I do have any funds for additional postdocs in the lab. However, if you are passionate about doing in doing a Postdoc in the lab, I would be willing to help find and apply for appropriate grants. Please contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a> to explore different Postdoc funding avenues.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Biology department at Texas Tech offers a wide variety of research facilities, including greenhouse and growth chamber space. Texas Tech also has a High Performance Computing Facility, well suited for running large-scale analyses and model simulations.</p>
      <p>Lubbock, Texas offers a low cost of living and high quality of life. Lubbock is situated within the heart of West Texas, within driving distance of canyons, mountains, forests, and prairie.</p></h3>
