      <h2>Graduate Students</h2>
      <p>The Smith lab is always looking for highly motivated Masters and Ph.D. students.
      <br>
      The lab is fully equipped to explore the response and feedback of plants to environmental change. 
      I am interested in students with diverse backgrounds in any one or combination of 
      plant physiology, ecology, mathematics, statistics, or modeling. 
      Though, a desire to broaden your skills is strongly preferred!
      <br>
      As a graduate student in my lab, you will be given the freedom to explore topics 
      and develop projects that you are passionate about. 
      To encourage the development of new skills, I may ask you to step outside your comfort zone. 
      I encourage collaboration among lab members as well as with other researchers at 
      Texas Tech and institutions with which we collaborate, including universities and national laboratories.
      <br>
      <p>I have funding to support students year round through a combination of 
      Research and Teaching Assistantships. 
      Additionally, we have funds for multi-scale field, lab, and computational experiments 
      as well as dissemination of research at local, national, and international meetings.
      <br>
      <p>Interested students can apply through the 
      <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/">Biology Department at Texas Tech</a>. 
      Further information, including application instructions and degree requirements can 
      be found <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/academics/graduate/">here</a>.
       Interested students are encouraged to contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a> 
       prior to applying.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h2>Postdocs</h2>
      <p>At the moment, I do not have any funds for additional postdocs in the lab. 
      However, if you are passionate about doing in doing a Postdoc in the lab, 
      I would be willing to help find and apply for appropriate grants. 
      Please contact <a href="mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu">Nick</a> 
      to explore different Postdoc funding avenues.
