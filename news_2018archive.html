      <h2><p>December 15, 2018:</h2><h3> Nick was in DC last week for the Fall meeting
      of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). AGU is a huge (20k+ people) meeting of
      of geoscientists, broadly defined. The meeting is packed with talks and poster
      presentations from scientists from a variety of career stages. Some of Nick's
      highlights from the week:
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <u> Monday (12/10) </u>: Nick convened an afternoon session on plant canopies. The session 
      included a diverse array of talks and posters from sub-cellular to global scales.
      Highlights of the oral session included 
      <a href = "https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/functionalbiogeography/index.php/People/JensKattge">
      Jens Kattge </a> introducing version 5 of the
      <a href = "https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php"> TRY </a> plant traits
      database, 
      <a href = "https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/douglas.morton">
      Doug Morton </a> discussing Amazonian canopy structure (only 60% of the
      canopy receives full sunlight!), 
      <a href = "https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/dr_holly_croft">
      Holly Croft </a> showing us how she is tracking
      global chlorophyll content and its relationship to other plant traits,
      <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerald_Page">
      </a> Gerald Page discussing leaf temperatures (note to modelers: 
      not the same as air temperatures!), 
      <a href = "https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/anthony-p-walker">
      Anthony Walker </a> speeding up his photosynthesis
      model with analytical solutions, 
      <a href = "https://bsc.ua.edu/graduate-directory/susanne-wiesner/">
      Susanne Weisner </a> telling us about canopy entropy,
      <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Pisek">
      Jan Pisek </a> measuring leaf angles, and 
      <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cheng-Wei_Huang">
      Cheng-Wei Huang </a> discussing coordinated
      physiology. Despite a few A/V malfunctions, it was a great session!
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The day concluded catching up with NGDev colleagues Beni Stocker
      and Wang Han over ramen.

      <br>
      
      <u> Tuesday (12/11) </u>: The onslaught of science continued into day 2.
      Around talks, Nick was able to do a bit of student recruiting for AGU-related
      labs in the Biology department at TTU. This included labs headed by
      <a href = "schwilk.org"> Dylan Schwilk </a>,
      <a href = "nvangestel.com"> Natasja Van Gestel </a>,
      as well as the <a href = "smithecophyslab.com"> Smith Ecophys Lab </a>.

      <br>
      <br>
      
      <u> Wednesday (12/12) </u>: Wednesday tends to be the most active day of the
      week at AGU, as both the folks that come early and leave early tend to
      be around. Nick was able to see a number of talks and was also able to
      connect with collaborator 
      <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TX7egiYAAAAJ&hl=en">
      Beni Stocker </a> (now at ETH in Zurich).
      Nick and Beni worked on incorporating Nick's version of an
      <a href = "https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/optimal_vcmax_R"> 
      optimal photosynthesis model </a> into the larger optimality-driven
      <a href = "https://github.com/stineb/rsofun"> P-model </a> for predicting
      GPP fluxes. Have a look at the two models and stay tuned for an upcoming
      paper describing Nick's model (forthcoming in <i> Ecology Letters </i>).
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Nick also attended a Purdue alumni event at the Cosmos Club in DC.
      At the event, members of the 
      <a href = "https://ag.purdue.edu/climate/">
      Purdue Climate Change Research Center </a>
      had an open discussion about climate impacts globally as well as in Indiana.
      It was a great outreach event. It'd be great to do something similar with TTU
      alumni through the 
      <a href = "https://www.depts.ttu.edu/csc/">
      Climate Science Center </a>.

      <br>
      <br>
      
      <u> Thursday (12/13) </u>: Thursday included more talks and continued recruiting.
      During lunch, Nick was able to catch up with members of the EaSM land management
      group, including 
      <a href = "https://frec.vt.edu/people/QThomas.html">
      Quinn Thomas </a> and his lab, 
      <a href = "http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jsdukes/Dukes.html">
      Jeff Dukes </a>, 
      <a href = "https://staff.ucar.edu/users/dll">
      Danica Lombardozzi </a>, and
      <a href = "https://staff.ucar.edu/users/wwieder">
      Will Wieder </a>. This was a nice precursor to the session that would be held the
      following day. Nick also caught up with former colleagues at the annual
      Purdue AGU reception at Matchbox Pizza.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <u> Friday (12/14) </u>: The last day of the meeting was a busy one! In the morning,
      Nick caught a number of good posters, including some excellent work on land 
      management. One poster, by 
      <a href = "https://engl.iastate.edu/directory/linda-shenk/">
      Linda Shenk </a>
      (Iowa State), stood out in particular. Dr. Shenk is an English professor who has
      teamed up with atmospheric scientists to develop a tool (or game) for assessing
      the climate and ecosystem impact of different management decisions. It'd be great
      to do something similar for producers and policy makers in West Texas!
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The afternoon included an oral session on land management in the Earth system.
      The session was a bit of a "Frankenstein" as it was a merger between three similar
      sessions (including one organized by Nick). Nonetheless, there was good cohesion
      amongst the talks and the session turned out great!

      We had a look at the flora of the region in hopes to resample some of the areas sampled by TTU botanists 50 years ago when the national park was first established.
      These samples have been preserved in the <a href = "http://www.mossmatters.com/herbarium/">TTU herbarium</a>.
      The temporal comparison will be used to examine genetic and physiological changes that have happened to the area over the past 50 years.

      At the NutNet workshop, we got to meet and mingle with other NutNetters.
      Our hosts, notably Elizabeth Borer, Eric Seabloom, and Ashley Asmus, emphasized productivity.
      As such, Lizz and Nick got to work developing a project that will examine leaf-to-whole-plant nitrogen allocation across a subset of the NutNet sites.
      We also started developing a physiology add-on experiment to examine plant carbon and water relations in response to nutrient additions across the network.

      <h2><p>July 21, 2018:</h2><h3> Nick spent the week in Indiana resampling plots at the Prairie Invasion and Climate Experiment (PRICLE).
      <br>
      <br>
      PRICLE was nitrogen addition by rainfall variability experiment that ran from 2012-2014.
      The experiment was located in a mixed-grass prairie dominated by Canada goldenrod (<i>Solidago canadensis</i>) and little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>).
      <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.12593"> The treatments acted to synergistically reduce plant species diversity and evenness by promoting the dominance of <i>S. canadensis</i>.</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      Although the experimental treatments ended after the 2014 growing season, the plots were kept in place.
      Nick resampled the plots this week to examine whether the short-term effects of the treatments persisted after the manipulations ended.
      That is, were the effects transient or did they result in a permanent change to the plant community?
      <br>
      <br>
      Stay tuned for the answer!

      <h2><p>July 3, 2018:</h2><h3> Check out a new paper from the lab, led by colleague Danica Lombardozzi (NCAR), entitled <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aacf68"> "Triose phosphate limitation in photosynthesis models reduces leaf photosynthesis and global terrestrial carbon storage."</a> 
      The unformatted version of the paper came out in Environmental Research Letters last week. The paper examines the sensitivity of models to TPU limitation, the understudied third limitation of photosynthesis. 
      We find that leaf photosynthesis and global terrestrial biosphere models are sensitive to how TPU limitation is parameterized. 
      For the leaf model, TPU limitation becomes more important at cold temperatures, high CO2 levels, and high light levels. 
      In a global model, the implementation of increased TPU limitation has a negative impact on simulated terrestrial carbon uptake and storage under present-day and future climates. 
      However, while we find TPU is an important process limiting photosynthesis globally, we note that it is highly understudied. 
      We need further experiments dedicated ot understanding TPU under various conditions and the acclimation of this process in particular.</h3>

      <h2><p>Apr 30, 2018:</h2><h3> Nick just had a new paper published in Ecology entitled "Drivers of leaf carbon exchange capacity across biomes at the continental scale."
      The paper examines the factors that influence photosynthetic and leaf respiratory traits across a variety of different plants and ecosystems.
      The study uses the <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.1992?campaign=wolacceptedarticle">LCE dataset</a> to drive the analyses.
      The dataset includes leaf gas exchange and trait data from 98 species spanning a 53° latitudinal gradient from Costa Rica to Alaska.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      The study finds that recent temperature and soil moisture interact to influence photosynthetic capacity.
      In dry areas, photosynthetic capacity is reduced with warming, but the downregulation trend is not apparent in wetter areas.
      This finding may reconcile meta-analytical studies that have found both a downregulation (Ali et al., 2015) and no response (e.g., Kattge and Knorr, 2007) of photosynthetic capacity to warming.
      The results also indicate that photosynthesis is more responsive to short-term (weekly) changes in temperature and soil moisture than it is to long-term climate.
      On the other hand, leaf respiratory capacity is less variable than photosynthesis and more responsive to long-term climate.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      In the Smith lab and with a global group of collaborators, we are now working on developing theoretical models to predict these responses from first principles.
      Stay tuned for more to come!

       The study comes out of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPfiKMY8Kw"> Boston Area Climate Experiment (BACE)</a>, a warming by precipitation manipulation experiment in Waltham, MA. 
       In the study, led by <a href="https://vikkirodgers.weebly.com/"> Vikki Rodgers</a>, we examined seedling trait responses (from leaf- to whole-plant scale) to the treatments and found that warming exacerbated plant sensitivity to rainfall.
