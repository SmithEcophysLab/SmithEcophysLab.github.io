      <p>In our lab, we study interactions between terrestrial ecosystems, 
      the global climate system, and other drivers of global change.
      We tend to focus on plants, but as many of our colleagues remind us, 
      we cannot forget about other players in the ecosystem, including insects, vertebrates, and soils.
      <br>
      <br>
      We use a combination of empirical studies at multiple scales and modeling to answer our questions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through our work, we hope to improve our understanding of how terrestrial ecosystems 
      regulate climate and global change.
      Ultimately, we aim to improve the reliability of future projections of our ever-changing world.
      <br>
      <br>
      Below is list of some ongoing projects in the lab.
      We are always looking to start new collaborations!

    	<h2>Physiological acclimation to environmental change</h2>
    	<h3>Key lab members: Evan Perkowski, Abigail Bell</h3>
    	<p>We are interested in understanding how plants adjust physiologically to environmental changes.
    	We are attacking this problem from multiple angles.
    	First, we are working to develop a theory of physiological acclimation to environmental change.
    	We are also using empirical studies to further examine the mechanisms underlying these responses
    	from the leaf to the whole plant.</p>

    	<h2>The impact of nutrients on physiology and ecosystem processes</h2>
    	<h3>Key lab members: Evan Perkowski</h3>
    	<p>In collaboration with the <a href = 'https://nutnet.org'> Nutrient Network</a>,
    	We are examining how nutrient addition influences plant physiological processess
    	and how this might feedback to influence competitive outcomes.
    	As such, we have set up a NutNet site in Lubbock.
    	At the site, we have many species co-occurring with vastly different physiological strategies.
    	The experiment here, and the comparison to other NutNet sites around the world,
    	will be used to help us understand how these strategies are influenced by
    	nutrient (N, P, K) addition and how these changes may impact plant community
    	structure.</p>

    	<h2>The influence of nutrient acquisition strategies on plant responses to global change</h2>
    	<h3>Key lab members: Evan Perkowski</h3>
    	<p>We are interested in understanding how nutrient acquisition strategies, and plant interactions with
    	belowground symbionts in particular, may influence long-term responses to global change.
    	Should nutrient acquisition strategy be part of the plant functional type framework of
    	Earth System Models?</p>

    	<h2>Land management feedbacks to global change</h2>
    	<h3>Key lab members: Risa McNellis, Dinah Borus</h3>
    	<p>Producers have a plethora of options available for managing their land.
    	Options are typically chosen with yield and costs in mind.
    	These options may have large consequences for feedbacks to climate.
    	In fact, some may benefit yield, reduce cost, and result in a negative feedback to climate change!
    	We are interested in understanding what those net positive land management decisions are
    	and communicating this to a broad audience.</p>
