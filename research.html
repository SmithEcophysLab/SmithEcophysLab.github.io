      <p>In our lab, we study interactions between terrestrial ecosystems, 
      the global climate system, and other drivers of global change.
      We tend to focus on plants, but as many of our colleagues remind us, 
      we cannot forget about other players in the ecosystem.
      <br>
      <br>
      We use a combination of empirical studies at multiple scales and modeling to answer our questions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through our work, we hope to improve our understanding of how terrestrial ecosystems 
      regulate climate and global change.
      Ultimately, we aim to improve the reliability of future projections of our ever-changing world.
      <br>
      <br>
      Below is list of some ongoing projects in the lab.
      We are always looking to start new collaborations!

    	<a id="intbio"></a><h2>IntBio: Defining the mechanisms and consequences of mutualism reorganization in the Anthropocene</h2>
    	<h3>Funding: National Science Foundation Integrative Biology (IntBio) program</h3>
    	<p>This IntBio project builds on a LTREB long-term “press” experiment that manipulates 
    	exotic plant invasion to address unexplored mechanisms of mutualism reorganization 
    	within four AIMS:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Determine intransient, long-term patterns of AM and pathogenic fungal 
    		communities and how they are reorganized by invasion.</li>
    		<li>Determine how reorganization of plant-AM fungal mutualisms affects plant 
    		physiology at the molecular level.</li>
    		<li>Determine the extent to which reorganization of plant-AM fungal 
    		mutualisms and/or soil nutrient availability impacts plant performance.</li>
    		<li>Experimentally addressing these aims will allow for multimodal integration 
    		to scale mutualism reorganization to demography.</li>
    	</ul>
    	Together, the project will address fundamental questions in the life sciences. 
    	The approach crosses different scales (spatial, temporal, levels of biological 
    	organization), and complexity, and will generate novel insights that will be 
    	broadly generalizable to mutualisms reorganization in other global change scenarios.</p>

    	<a id="career"></a><h2>Improving understanding and prediction of photosynthetic acclimation to global change</h2>
    	<h3>Funding: National Science Foundation CAREER program</h3>
    	<p>We are interested in understanding how photosynthesis acclimates to environmental changes,
    	both above- and below-ground. This includes tackling the following questions:
    	<ul>
    		<li>How do soil nutrients and nutrient acquisition alter acclimation responses?</li>
    		<li>What do plants acclimate to and how long does it take?</li>
    		<li>How does photosynthetic acclimation alter community- and ecosystem-scale processes?</li>
    	</ul>
    	This work is being led by postdocs and graduate students in the lab. We are also
    	creating course based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) as part of the project.</p>

    	<h3>Funding: Schmidt Futures VESRI program</h3>
    	<p>In collaboration with many other institutions, we are working on ways to improve
    	the reliability of land surface model simulations. This large, collaborative project
    	includes modeling groups, remote sensing group, and experimentalists (like us!).
    	We will be working closely with other groups to design experiments that
    	can test and help to develop new theory that can be used to improve
    	land surface models.</p>

    	culturally important forests in Concord, MA</h2>
    	<h3>Funding: National Parks Service Preservation Technology and Training Grants Program</h3>
    	<p>In this project, we are examining culturally important populations of Pitch Pines
    	in Concord Massachusetts. These are the plants that Thoreau and other Transcendentalists
    	wrote about! These pines are at risk of being attached by Southern Pine Beetle as
    	its populations move north along the Eastern seaboard with global warming. We are
    	setting up a monitoring program to identify signals of infestation in hopes of saving
    	these trees from SPB attack.</p>

    	<h3>Funding: Texas Ecological Laboratory</h3>
    	<p>Here we are using a E-W precipitation gradient across Texas to explore
    	the drivers of plant nitrogen. This work will have implications for
    	our basic understanding of these driving processes as well as more applied implications
    	for different forms of land use including agricultural, ranch, and wildlife management.
    	Notably, this project will test theoretical assumptions about how plants acclimate
    	to resource gradients.</p>

    	<a id="potato"></a><h2>Potato productivity under global change</h2>
    	<h3>Funding: United States Department of Agriculture Borlaug Fellowship Program</h3>
    	<p>Producers have a plethora of options available for managing their land.
    	Options are typically chosen with yield and costs in mind.
    	However, yield impacts are hard to predict, especially under novel environments.
    	In this project, we are examining potato responses to global change using experiments
    	and measurements that allow us to model projections under future global change.
    	In particular, we are looking at management practices that can mitigate negative
    	impacts of global change, particularly those that would be feasible for implementation
    	in Kenya. This is being led by Borlaug Fellow Dinah Borus.</p>
