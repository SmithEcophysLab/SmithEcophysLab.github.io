      <a id="waring_2023"></a><h2>May 27, 2023: Lizz has a paper published in JXB!</h2>
      
      <p>
      Former postdoc Lizz Waring, along with Evan and Nick, published a new paper in
      <i>Journal of Experimental Botany</i> entitled
      <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jxb/erad195/7180841?redirectedFrom=fulltext">
      "Soil nitrogen fertilization reduces relative leaf nitrogen allocation to photosynthesis"</a>.
      The paper details the results of a study examining plant acclimation responses to a
      factorial combination of light and nitrogen availability. Interestingly, plants grown under
      increasing levels of soil nitrogen availability allocated relatively less nitrogen
      in their leaves to photosynthesis. This, along with large increases in biomass, suggest
      that plant responses to soil nitrogen are primarily associated with allocation of leaf
      nitrogen to non-photosynthetic processes as well as the building of new tissue.

      The full article can be found on the Journal's website 
      <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jxb/erad195/7180841?redirectedFrom=fulltext">

      Figure 3 from the paper showing that the fraction of leaf nitrogen allocated to
      different photosynthetic components is reduced with increased soil nitrogen components
      in both species and under all light treatments.

      <p>
      Nick, Snehanjana, Isa, Rafael, and Garrison joined members of the
      <a href="http://www.mossmatters.com/">Johnson</a> and
      <a href="https://schwilk.org/">Schwilk</a> labs to sample plants along
      an elevational gradient at the Guadalupe Mountains National Park.
      This sampling, in part, replicates efforts by TTU researchers in the 1970s and allows
      us to compare plant genetic and trait information from then to now. Herbarium samples
      were also collected to support future studies. The project will support the PhD work
      of Johnson lab member Madison Bullock.

      <p>
      Evan graduated with his PhD entitled <i>Drivers of plant nutrient acquisition and
      strategy and their influence on plant responses to environmental change</i>.
      It was a great defense that showed off all the amazing work Evan has done since
      joining the lab in 2018. Evan will be sticking around in the lab, starting
      as a postdoc working on the <a href="https://www.smithecophyslab.com/research#intbio">garlic mustard invasion project</a>.

      Nick and Evan attended the 2023 meeting of the European Geophysical Union.
      Evan presented his work on the influence of nitrogen availability and acquisition
      strategy on plant acclimation to elevated CO2. Evan's abstract can be found
      <a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-3518.html">here</a>.
      Nick presented work that former postdoc Brad Posch led examining the temperature
      response of the quantum efficiency of photosystem II. Brad's abstract can be found

      Every Spring the lab heads out to the local lbb.us <a href="https://nutnet.org/">Nutrient Network</a>
      site to apply its yearly allotment of fertilizer. The experiment is a fully factorial
      N by P by K addition experiment. The fertilizer is applied in the Spring at rates of
      10 g m-2 year-1. Core data are collected eery year in support of this globally
      distributed experiment. For data and more information about the lubb.us site, see our

      Monika Kelley (MS), Eve Gray (MS), Isabella Beltran Triana (MS), and Rafael Freitas (MS).
      Alissar Cheiab also joined us as a postdoc in early 2023. And Kelly Carroll
      joined as our lab manager around the same time.
